# 🚀 Operating Systems Playground

Welcome to the **Operating Systems Playground**! Here, we dive into the nuts and bolts of operating systems with a splash of fun and a dash of code. Explore our different sections, each designed to showcase the magic of system-level programming in C!

## 🌟 Contents

### 1. **Shared Memory**

Ah, shared memory—where processes become best friends! This section shows you how two (or more) independent processes can share a common memory space. It's like having a common diary where everyone can write and read. 📚

**What's Inside:**
- **Creating Shared Memory:** Set up the playground!
- **Attaching/Detaching:** Join or leave the fun.
- **Synchronization:** Keep everyone in sync!

**How to Play:**
1. **Compile the Fun:**
   ```bash
   gcc -o shared_memory shared_memory.c
### 🗄️ Memory Mapped Files

Welcome to the Memory Mapped Files extravaganza! Imagine you have a file and you want to interact with it as if it’s just a chunk of memory. No need for file I/O functions—just map it straight into memory and work with it like a pro. Ready to dive into the magic of `mmap`?

**Here’s What You’ll Discover:**

- **Mapping Files into Memory:** Turn that file into a memory block! 🧩
- **Reading and Writing:** Treat file data just like you would with regular variables. 📝
- **Synchronization:** Keep everything in perfect harmony. ⚖️

**How to Get Started:**

1. **Compile the Program:**
   Fire up your terminal and compile the code with the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc -o memory_mapped_files memory_mapped_files.c
### 📬 Message Queue

Welcome to the Message Queue section—where processes send and receive messages like pros! Think of message queues as the ultimate inter-process communication (IPC) tool. They help different processes exchange information without needing to be directly connected. Ready to dive into this communication channel magic?

**Here’s What You’ll Discover:**

- **Creating Queues:** Set up your very own message delivery system! 📦
- **Sending Messages:** Pass notes between processes with ease. 📨
- **Receiving Messages:** Retrieve those messages and keep the conversation going. 📩
- **Synchronization:** Ensure no message gets lost in transit. 🔄

**How to Get Started:**

1. **Compile the Program:**
   Start by compiling the code with the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc -o message_queue message_queue.c
