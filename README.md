### 1. Shared Memory

This section contains examples of creating and managing shared memory between two independent processes. Shared memory is a powerful method for inter-process communication (IPC) that allows multiple processes to access the same memory space, facilitating data exchange and synchronization.

**Features:**
- Creating shared memory segments.
- Attaching and detaching shared memory to/from processes.
- Synchronization mechanisms for coordinating access to shared memory.

**Usage:**
1. **Compile the Program:**
   ```bash
   gcc -o shared_memory shared_memory.c
